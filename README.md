<p align="center">
This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings from the 15-month <strong>Apprenticeship program</strong> at <strong>Cisco Systems.</strong></br>
It included a 3-month coding bootcamp focused on HTML5, CSS3, pure Vanilla JavaScript, version control, and fundamental programming concepts, followed by on-the-job learning.
