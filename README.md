<h1 align="center"> Multiverse - RISE Apprenticeship üåêüíªüìö</h1>

</div>
<p align="center">
This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings from the 15-month <strong>Apprenticeship program</strong> at <strong>Cisco Systems.</strong></br>
It included a 3-month coding bootcamp focused on HTML5, CSS3, pure Vanilla JavaScript, version control, and fundamental programming concepts, followed by on-the-job learning.

## ABOUT ME üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
- I'm Jessica, originally from Brazil and now based in New York since March 2020. Passionate about tech and intrigued by *Web development*.
- Joined Cisco Systems in September 2022 as part of the first cohort for the **RISE (Recognizing Inclusive Success and Excellence)** Apprenticeship Program.
- I transitioned to an Agile team within the **Common Services** as part of their engineering team, working on the **Object Service** project.

## Project and Team I've Collaborated With ü§ù
- The **Object Service project** provides a unified object repository for efficient object creation and editing across multiple **Cisco solutions**, ensuring future policy sharing.
- Gained hands-on experience with front-end and back-end tasks:
  - Front-End: Developed reusable Figma-based components. **React, TypeScript, Jest** for unit testing, and **GitHub Actions** for **CI/CD**.
    
  - Back-End: Extended endpoints for static objects (e.g., host, CIDR, and Fully Qualified Domain Name) with CRUD operations. **Java Spring Boot, TestNG, Mockito** for unit testing and **Jenkins** for **CI/CD**.

## Bootcamp Projects
### Front-end Project
 -   Front-end project folder will include "Crush Club - Wine Lovers UI" application using **TypeScript** and **React**, demonstrating ability to build components and develop user interfaces. 
 -   **Skills Developed**: `Problem-solving`, `API integration`, `user experience (UX) design`, `code debugging` using Chrome DevTools and Visual Studio Code
 -   **Link to the project**: [Crush Club Wines UI](https://github.com/JessicaRodriguesFelix/final-portfolio-multiverse-apprenticeship/tree/main/front-end-project)
### Back-end Project
 -   Back-end project folder will include "Crush Club - Wine Lovers" application using **Java Spring Boot**, demonstrating ability to create endpoints for performing CRUD operations. 
 -   **Skills Developed**: `Problem-solving`, data schema and endpoint `design and evaluation`, `testing` Postman, and `code debugging` with the IntelliJ debugger.
 -   **Link to the project**: [Crush Club Wines](https://github.com/JessicaRodriguesFelix/final-portfolio-multiverse-apprenticeship/tree/main/back-end-project)
 ### Deployment Project
 -  Deployment Project folder will contain "Crush Club - Wine Lovers", an extension of the back-end project with added GitHub Actions jobs for automating the build, testing, and deployment pipeline.
 -  **Skills Developed**: `Problem-solving`,`version control`,`quality assurance`,`automation` and `CI/CD`.
 -  **Link to the project**: [Crush Club Wines](https://github.com/JessicaRodriguesFelix/final-portfolio-multiverse-apprenticeship/tree/main/deployment-project)
### Hackathon Project
 -  Hackaton project folder will contain "Coplay", a full-stack project designed as an introduction to the 'Golang' programming language.
 -  **Skills Developed**: `Problem-solving`,`time management`, `task planning`, `documentation`, `testing` Postman, and `code debugging` with the Visual Studio Code.
 -  **Link to the project**: [Coplay](https://github.com/JessicaRodriguesFelix/final-portfolio-multiverse-apprenticeship/tree/main/hackaton-project)<!-- _target="blank" -->
