<p align="center">
This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings from the 15-month <strong>Apprenticeship program</strong> at <strong>Cisco Systems.</strong></br>
It included a 3-month coding bootcamp focused on HTML5, CSS3, pure Vanilla JavaScript, version control, and fundamental programming concepts, followed by on-the-job learning.

## ABOUT ME üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
- I'm Jessica, originally from Brazil and now based in New York since March 2020. Passionate about tech and intrigued by *Web development*.
- Joined Cisco Systems in September 2022 as part of the first cohort for the **RISE (Recognizing Inclusive Success and Excellence)** Apprenticeship Program.
- I transitioned to an Agile team within the **Common Services** as part of their engineering team, working on the **Object Service** project.

## Project and Team I've Collaborated With ü§ù
- The **Object Service project** provides a unified object repository for efficient object creation and editing across multiple **Cisco solutions**, ensuring future policy sharing.
- Gained hands-on experience with front-end and back-end tasks:
  - Front-End: Developed reusable Figma-based components. **React, TypeScript, Jest** for unit testing, and **GitHub Actions** for **CI/CD**.
    
  - Back-End: Extended endpoints for static objects (e.g., host, CIDR, and Fully Qualified Domain Name) with CRUD operations. **Java Spring Boot, TestNG, Mockito** for unit testing and **Jenkins** for **CI/CD**.

## Bootcamp Projects
### Front-end Project
 -   Developed a front-end application using **TypeScript** and **React**, demonstrating my ability to build components and develop user interfaces. 
 -   Skills Developed: `Problem-solving` and `code debugging` using Chrome DevTools and Visual Studio Code

### Back-end Project
 -   Developed a back-end application using **Java Spring Boot**, demonstrating capability to create endpoints for performing CRUD operations. 
 -   Skills Developed: `Problem-solving`, data schema and endpoint `design and evaluation`, `testing` Postman, and `code debugging` with the IntelliJ debugger.
